**Note:** Before we start first we need to check these ports 3307,8088,443,9000
If they are used, we need to determinate them

After cloning Repo
Just run (it Takes some time)
```bach 
sudo docker-compose up -d --build 
```
Or if you using docker compose V2 run

```bach 
sudo docker compose up -d --build 
```

Run The App On Port 8088
